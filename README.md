Transponder_Code
================

Code for the Arduino projector cart transponders.  This code is meant to run on an Arduino Yun with an appropriate DB9 shield.  It allows the device to be connected to a data projector, which it will poll for information.  It then reports this information back to a Crestron controller, running the PortableProjectorPackage server code.
